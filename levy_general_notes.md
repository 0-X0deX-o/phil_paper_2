TITLE=INFORMATION_OVERLOAD

20.1 Introduction
    - Is it any wonder that information overload is such a common place complaint these days?
    - On the face of it, Information overload would seem to be a straight forward phenomenon
    - I cannot hope to address, or certainly answer all, these questions in this relatively brief article.

20.2 What is Information Overload?
    - Exposure to or provision of too much information
    
    - Refers to the state of having too much information to make a decision or remain informed about a topic.
    
    - Information overload, according to these two definitions, is a condition in which an agent has -- or is exposed to, or is provide with -- too much information, and suffers negative consequences as a result
    
    - At the heart of this understanding of the phenomenon is a fairly simple conception of human information processing
    
    - While this might seem like a straightforward and unproblematic notion, it realises variety of questions, concerns, and complexities. I will briefly mention four.


    20.2.1 What is information
        - How can one decide if one is suffering from information overlaod without knowing the range of phoenomena encompassed by the word information?

        - Among scholars who concern themselves with information from a theoretical perspective, however, there is little agreement about the notion.

    20.2.2 More than information
        - The two definitions above seem to suggest that information overload is simply concerned with an excess of information.

        - Central to judgments of excess is some notion of cacacity: a person or organization can only handle so much information in a given period of time.

    20.2.3 Perception of Reality
        - Is information overload simply a question of one's subjective state - that one feels overloaded - or must there be some objective reality to it?


    20.2.4 A Novel, Recurrent, or Ever-Present Phenomenon? 
        - It has been suggested that we conceive of information overload today as a uniques phenomoenenon, "an immediate phenomonon-without a history- that the current generation uniquely faces for the first time."

        - While it seems wise not to assume that information overload is an entirely new phoneonmenon, we should also be careful not to assume that the sixteenth century experience of excess is (exactly) the same phenonmenon we are dealing with today.

20.3 A brief history of the phrase
    - Having briefly explored the concept of information overload, including some of the nuances and questions that surround it, I now want to examine the history of the phrase.

    - In 1962, Richard L. Meier, published a scholarly monograph, A Communications Theory of Urban Growth, which applied then-current ideas in information and communication theoryt to the organization of cities.

    - In an article published the same year, "Operation Basic: the retrieval of wasted knowledge", Bertram M. Gross, a professor of political science at Syracuse Unsiversity, argured that the accelerating rate of publication was threatening science and society with and "information crisis"

    - In 1966 the economist Kenneth Boulding published a journal article in which he declared that "management science... is an alternative defense against information overload"

    - Also in 1967, a paid advertisement appeared in the New York Times announcing the publication and sale of a book titled EDUNET: Report of the SUmmer Study on Information Networks, a report by an academic coalition outlinging a plan "for a vast interunicersity commuications network."

    - In 1969, an article on rock music -- "All You Need is Love. Love is All You Need"

    - Although Alvin Toffler neither coined the phrase nor introdueced it inot the culture his vastly popular book may well have been the first to discuss the topic at some length in a form that was accessible to the general public.

    - In the last third of the book, Toffler addressed "The limits of adaptablility," arguing that the human organism remains, "a biosystmen with a limited capacity for change"

    - It is a striking feature of these early citations that authors apparently felt no need to define what they meant by "information overload"

    - Much of this linguistic transparency seems to have come from the meaning of the word "overload," and its root word "load."
    
    - But the OED also identifies various extensions or specializations of these core meanings.

    - The word "Information" has a much more complex history.

    - The period from the 1970s to the present has witnessed the explosive growth of information and communication technologies, including personal computers, e-mail, instant messaging, the World Wide Web , and cell phones.

    - Finally, it should be noted, other phrases are in current use that relate to, or overlap with, "information overload" in various ways, including "data overload", information anxiety, "information pollution," "information fatigue syndrome," "data smog," and "technostress."

20.4 Causes of Information Overload

    - For the phrase "information overload" to have been introduced so casually and unproblematically in the 1960s, the groundwork must have been laid earlier.

    - Concerns specifically about an excess or overabundance of information were being expressed in this period, too.

    - By the 1960s, then, the language was ripe for use, and the perception existed that there awas jmore information than could b3e prooperly handled.

    - But when did this sshift begin and how did it come about?

    - But by the mid-nineteenth century, mass production and accelerated rates of distribution and consumption had precipitated what Beniger calls a "control crisis": both human and technical systems for managing the increased flow were found to be inadequate.

    - The solution to this control crisis, beniger explains, was a "control revolution": the development of a while series of innovations in information technologies and practices.

    - As a result of this trasnsformation, American society, as well as other industrial economies, has witnessed a fairly steady increase in production: more priducts circulating more quickly.

    - Hanging over the econommy, however,. has been the inevitable double fear -- of overproducation and underaproduction.

- There is an irony in the increased production and use of information goods.

    - The World Wide Web provides and interesting example of this phenomenon.

    - From this perspective, then, information overload is simply an inevitable consequence of ceratain economic conditions and the philosophy of life that underlies them - a philosophy I have elsewhere called "more-faster-better"

    - What then is truly novel about today's sense of information overload aned what is simply, the recurrence, or the ongoing presence, of an older phenomenon?

    - But at the same time, we might note certain features of the current experience that may be unique to this period of informatization.

    What's more, many aspects of tthese interactions are bureaucratic in nature: filling in forms, pushing buttons to interact with voice mail phone trees, sending task-oriented e-mail messages around the globe.

    - So it may be that some of the concerns being registered as information overload don't simply have to do with the amount of information we are dealing with, or the inability of our current control systems to handle them.
    
20.5 Consequences of Information Overload

    - Information overload, as we have seen, involves more than just the exposure of an agent to excessive amounts of information, that agent must also suffer certain negative effects as a result.

    - Faced with more information the we can handle in an allotted time, we sfind various ways just to get by.

    - Information overload may have consequences not only for the task but for the well being of the person perfroming it, who may expreience am dimninished sense of accomplishment and a heightened degree of stress.

    - It should hardly be surprising if information overtload also has negative consequences for ethical behavior.

    - The overwhelming amount of information now presented through media outlets, for example, can make it difficult to stay in touch with those stories that require compassionate action on our part - as wehn the news about Anna Nicole Smith drices the dire circumstances in Darfur off trhe front page and out of public consciousness.

    - Clearly then, there are times when information overload may lead people to fail to repsond to, or to notice, what is important ethically.

    - Whybrow covers some of the same territory. 

    - A recent scientific study reported in the New York Times (Carey 2006) offers evidence that when people who hold strong politically partisan views are given contravening information, they  reject those views quickly and unconsciously using a part of their brain more assopciated with emotional activity than with reasoning.

    - In the analysis I have present hers, ;information overload is one of the sied effects of an information ociety operating under a "more-faster-better" philosophy of life.

    - Can nothing be done then to stem the tide?

    - How successful these different forms of technical, social, and legal intervention have been, or will be depends largely on the specific circumstances within which they are embedded.
