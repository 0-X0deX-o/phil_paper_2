REASONS
    you made me do that
    you have learned a form of witchcraft that pojects the will of the perosn to someone else
    in what possible world would something like this ever be permissible
    God is going to destroy your soul in hell for what you are doing to me
        making me an experiement
        using all forms of harassment that you can concievalby getaway with to torture me into submission..

--Section 1--
1. Your social life has a biological limit: 150.
2. What makes a relationship meaningful?
3. Some critics have questioned Dunbar's conclusion
4. A lot is wrong with the internet
5. Online media gives the everyperson access to channels
6. And we also received a toxic dump of garbage.
7. It's long past time to question a fundamental premise of online life:

--Section 2--
8. The process of giving someone a direct relationship with anyone else is sometimes called disintermediation
9. The gospel of engagement duped people into mistaking using the software with carrying out meanigful or even successful online speech rather than a sign of its obvious failure.
10. Thus, the quentity of material being produced, and the size of the audiences subject to it, became unalloyed goods.
11. The capacity to reach an audience some of the time became controted into the right to reach every audience all of the time.
12. My colleague Adirenne LaFrance has named the fundamental assumption, and danger, of social media megascale.
13. So far, controlling that tidal wave of content has been seen as a task to be carried out after the fact.
14. Regulatory intervention, if it ever comes, also won't solve the problem.
15. Wouldn't it just be better if fewer people posted less stuff


--Section 3--
16. Limiting social media may seem impossible
17. Even the capacity to respond to a Facebook post, Twitter DM, Slack message, or other online matter with likes, emotes, or emoji constrains what peopl can do when t;hey use those services.
18. Yet despite the many material limitations that make popular online tools what they are, few platforms ever limit the colume of posts or the reach of users in a clear and legible way.
19. Imagine if access and reach were limited too
20. Such a constraint would be technically trivial to impliment.
21. A better example of a limited network exists, one that managed to solve many of the problems of social web through design, but that didn't survive long enough to see the perks of its logic.

--Section 4--
22. In 2010, Paul Adams led a social-resarch team at Google, where he hoped to create something that would help people maintain and buld relationships online.
23. This understanding of strong ties was central to Google+.
24. Adams also wanted to heed a lesson from the socialogist Mark Granovetter.
25. Weak ties can lead to new opportunities, ideas, and perspectives
26. Adams's book feels lik a prediction of everything that would go wrong with the Internet.
27. You know how this story ends.

--Section 5--
28. Up until now, social reform online has been seen either as a problem for even more technology to solve, or as one that demands regularoty intervention.
29. Imposing more, and more meaningful, constraints on internet services, by contrast, is both aesthetically and legally compatible with theform and business of the technology industry.
30. Regulatory interventions have gotten nowhere because they fail to engage with the material conditions of megascale, wheich makes policing all thos peopl and all that content simply too hard.
31. Conversely, design constraints on audience and reach that apply equally to everyone offer a means to enforce a suppression of contact, communication, and spread.
32. This would be a painful step to take, because everyone has become accustomed to megascale.
