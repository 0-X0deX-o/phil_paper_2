wirte the paper for enjoyability rather than for purely acadmeic value

Who is my audience
    Prof. A. Butler.

What does she consider to be a paper worthy of an 'A'
how to style the document so that it is refreshing to read
how to make the paper stand out enough to help her to enjoy it
turn the paper in early
I'm concerned that I'll have to study all of the articles over again
there are two provided, but I'm not sure if the remaining articles will be necessary to complete the paper


After a third reading the first part of the book chapter resonates more clearly than the latter part but that is only because I began to lose focus concerning the material I was reading. The reasons for this were the very prevalent and difficult circumstances that I’ve had to overcome. The question of why I have to experience any of this to begin with and how everything is all related to me and why all of this has had such a negative effect not only on me but everyone else that I’m surrounded by.
Despite all of that, there is some philosophical analysis that I hadn’t seen before concerning what exactly information is to begin with to then develop the idea of what it is to be inundated by it. 
I think that it goes without saying that literally no one wants to have someone else control everything that that person thinks says or does.
There needs to be a more accurate representation of the analysis of the document. 
Lets see what I can recall from memory
	Chapter one is an introduction that consists of two paragraphs
		Paragraph one is about a cursory introduction to information overload and the second is a introductory definition ot lwhat information is and then segways into how the remainder of the document is going to be laid out.

	Section2 goes into defining exactyly what information is
		Split into four sections
			1 is what is information
			2 is what is information overload
			3 reality or perception
			4 whether or not information overload is a current, constant or future problem
	Section 3 goes into a brief history of the phrase includ	
And I’ve arrived at a place where I must review the text to properly write this paper
Which demonstrates to me that I don’t have a full enough grasp on the document to write a paper about it.

Paper 2 outline
    Begin by describing what Levy describes information to be and highlight that much of the theoretical definitions do not support real analysis of information overload.

    devlope a summary of Levy's understanding of what information overload is and the implied characteristics of information overload.
        Distinguish the differnces between a simple over abundance of information contrasted to what available information used to be available in the centuries previous to this, but rather that both the authors were speaking with reference to a context of the thinking of a person that is using a computer for work. At least this is most certainly true for Levy.
    For example, the abundance of information that is available today might make others have a sense of security or of academia rather than stress.
    acknowledge the process with which a person consumes and recognizes information

    acknowledge that a persons perception to the feeling of being overwhelmed in this context is enough to  define information overload thus information overload is subjective.

    give a cursory linear development of the etymology of the word (this needs to come before the development of the idea and consequences of information overload)

    to begin a concrete analysis of and quantifiying information overload with the illustration of an electircal circuit as the author gives an example within the text.

    refer to the causes and of information overload as something that is addressed before the concrete illustrations of the paper

    refer to the consequences of information overload second to last before you begin to illustrate the concept of a circuit being overloaded to segway into Bogost's analysis.



What is Dunbar's number?
    150 people that you can have meaningful relationships with
    15 people that you have the closest relationships with

Can relate the acumulation of information in terms of greater quatity vs the idea of relationships which inspires a sort of concept of relating the interactions that a person has with information in the same manner that a person has with another person.

Bogost explicitly refers to the media of the internet rather than that of the inplication of the internet as the primary driver in the availability of information

refers to some of the information being garbage rather than the response of it being an overload

disintermediation

Bogost referes to the abundance of infromation in terms of social media posts, etc.

Limiting social media with respect to screening information as a whole how that does and does not apply to the situation that Levy is presenting.

A proposed solution is posting less, which translated to a general context is that others don't produce as much information


this then prompts an idea
    if there was always as much information as there has ever been, what is the actual cause of the proliferation of information in terms of flow rate, what is the difference then between the amount of information recieved in generations passed and the current generation and what could be effective in terms of "posting" less within this context.

    If information has increased since generations passed, then is the increase then a partial cause of the information overload and then identifying how to stop producing as much information.

    Explain and talk about the overabundance of information in terms of socail media explain with more depth Bogost's article

tweets can bo 280 characters long and no more
throttling of what is issued in social media
why are so many trying to keep me from succeeding?

still looking at the person responsible for making the social media posts rather than at information in general or at how the receiver is responsible with how much data that the person consumes

which brings to mind an interesting concept
    the text of the book chapter was written for the context of a person who is going to be working in the computer science field how could a person then throttle thier reception of information in a general context

    still only in reference to social media posts

    throttling also the amount of inivduals that you can have connections with online for instance, Bogost uses linkedin and keeping your friends to a minimum or at a listed cap of 500.

    introduces the idea that a person with too many ties to others than focuses more on the weaker ties than that of the stronger ties.

    don't rely on how you feel rely on doing what you know will win 

    "He who has relied least on fortune is established as the strongest." Niccolo Machiavelli

    well that went well

    how about that
