2. David M. Levy, “Information Overload”Download “Information Overload”

>Levy claims that “information overload” causes a variety of problems, including impairments to cognition and decision-making which hollow out our relationships and 
>ultimately leads to moral decay. Bogost considers the aspect of social media which encourages us to maximize the number of people in our group, without special focus 
>on the quality. Bogost proposes a social and technological fix: limit the number of people a single user can have in their group. The goal of this paper is to use 
>Levy’s analysis to discuss Bogost’s diagnosis and proposed solution. In what ways would Levy agree with Bogost’s diagnosis? In what ways might Levy disagree? Would 
>Bogost’s solution address any of the problems of “information overload”? Would Bogost’s solution create more problems?
